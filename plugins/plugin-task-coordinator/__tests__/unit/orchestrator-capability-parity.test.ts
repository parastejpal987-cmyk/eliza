/**
 * Regression guard for orchestrator capability manifest↔dispatch parity.
 *
 * The orchestrator views declare their capabilities in `src/index.ts`
 * (`ORCHESTRATOR_CAPABILITIES`); `src/orchestrator-capabilities.ts` exports the
 * gate set (`ORCHESTRATOR_CAPABILITY_IDS`, the registry `interact` checks
 * before dispatch) and the dispatcher (`runOrchestratorCapability`). If those
 * drift — a capability declared but not handled, or handled but not declared —
 * a voice/NL planner either surfaces an action that no-ops or can't discover
 * one that works (it previously had: `orchestrator-update-task` /
 * `-validate-task` were dispatched but undeclared).
 *
 * This compares the REAL imported objects structurally (no source-text regex),
 * and drives the real dispatcher for every declared id to prove none falls
 * through to the unknown-capability branch. Only the `@elizaos/ui` HTTP client
 * — the module's outbound boundary — is faked.
